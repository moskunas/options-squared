# op²

Platform to assist in option opportunity-discovery (hence op²). 
It was inspired after reading Barclay's paper regarding the impact of retail options trading.
The paper can be found [here](https://www.docdroid.net/5gM68EW/barclays-us-equity-derivatives-strategy-impact-of-retail-options-trading-pdf).

The goal of this platform is to support not only the ideas outlined in the paper above, but to support other helpful utilities in regard to options.

The platform was not created to execute strategies. It was created to show viable candidates a given strategy may be most usefully paired with, whether it be options or naked shares.
